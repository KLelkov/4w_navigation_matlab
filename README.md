# 4w_navigation_matlab
Matlab version of 4w_robot navigation algo. Used for testing

1. Load the raw data from .mat file
2. Run raw_data_cleaner script to clean & cut it
3. Run plot_raw script to see raw data plots to have an idea about how robot was moving
4. Run main script to test the navigation algo

So far the sript works well on test1 data only. Should probably change something to make odometry more trustworthy.
